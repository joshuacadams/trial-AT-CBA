### Diversion rates

When an active transport project is introduced, the diversion rate measures the original transport mode of active travellers who are using the project in the opening year. This enables quantification of the changed travel patterns: trips, trip-kilometres, trip-hours by mode for use in appraisal of the project. 

Diversion rates are useful for small to medium sized projects that will have some impact on demand and are likely to generate new active travel trips. As the size of an initiative increases, the use of a demand model may be worthwhile.

Demand for an active travel project will come from a combination of:
- Reassignment: an existing active travel trip that changed their path to use the new facility.
- Diverted from car: a new active travel trip previously made by car.
- Diverted from public transport: a new active travel trip previously made by public transport.
- New: a trip that has been generated by the project, from someone that would not otherwise have travelled.

Diversion rates are used to calculate net benefits which will vary depending on previous trip mode. Benefits tend to be derived from improved safety and reduced travel time resulting from the project. Net benefit calculations also include the reduction in externality costs, such as congestion and health system costs, associated with new trips. 

Diversion rates can vary significantly depending on the type, quality and location of the project, how it fits within the broader active transport network and the attractiveness of the motorised alternatives. In most cases, reassigned trips will represent the largest proportion of trips following the project opening. Where there are limited public transport options in the corridor the proportion of diverted trips from public transport will be negligible. Diversion from cars will be higher in areas with heavier congestion. The practitioner will need consider the most appropriate diversion rates given the local travel patterns and transport network.

The default values provided may be representative of a new inner-city off-road shared path where there is likely to be many public transport alternatives and relatively high road congestion levels.
