### Intersection treatments

Use this section to include safety improvements for any intersection treatments as part of the project.

Note that safety improvements from moving trips between surface types (e.g. from on-road to an on-road bikelane) will already be calculated. This section is for additional safety benefits from altering an intersection with known risks of injury or death.

See: [ATAP M4 5.5.2](https://www.atap.gov.au/mode-specific-guidance/active-travel/5-estimation-of-benefits) for a guide to the effectiveness of intersection treatments.
