### Value of travel time

Travel time is generally a disincentive to travel for transport trips (journey to work or education, trips for shopping and other personal business, and on employersâ€™ business). This means that time savings are typically recognised as a benefit for active travel trips. 

Travel time savings are calculated based on time savings per trip, the number of transport trips and the value of travel time unit values.
